# FuzzyString
All of the algorithms used here have been pulled from online resources, translated into C#, and compiled into this library. I found several other similar open-source implementations around but nothing for .NET/C#. Adding the *.dll to your project will give you access to this extension and the individual extensions under the hood of the ApproximatelyEquals() extension.
